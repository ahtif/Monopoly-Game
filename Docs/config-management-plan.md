#h4 Source Control

1. Our group will use branches for each individual person
-Our group understands how source control works and we are comfortable using it.We chose to do this because it ensures that the master branch consists of only high quality code.  

#h4 Code Reviews

1. Our group will perform code reivews on every branch that wants to be merged into the master. 
-We chose to do this because it allows all code to be reviewed before being pushed to the master and it means that one person is not constantly reviewing everyones code all day. We wil use git hubs pull request system to do this. 

-?? Other automated check systems?

#h4 Coding Standards

1. We will use the Google checkstyle standard 
- We are doing this so that we all understand the rules involved and they can be easily looked up if anyone is confused. In addition a stadardized checkstyle will make our code pretty.
