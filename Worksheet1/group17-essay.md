A Comparison of Software Development Systems: Waterfall vs Agile
=================================================================
### By Greg Allen and Joel Benner - Group 17


###Introduction


Software development can be a tricky thing to get right, there are so many components to any project that it can be overwhelming. Luckily some strategies have been thought up and are well documented. Two of the most commonly used in business today are the waterfall and agile methods.  While both have a few similarities they are two completely different approaches to solving the same problem. 


###The Waterfall Model


The waterfall model takes a sequential approach to software design. Software is designed in steps (usually being requirements, design, implementation, testing, installation, and maintenance). You begin through requirements elicitation to discover what resources the project needs to be successful or if the project is achievable. Design and then implement the design and test the software to discover bugs or errors. If testing is successful the software is installed so the customer can begin using it and maintained throughout its life cycle. If testing results in a failure we go back to the first step to re-discover and re-define our project requirements.
Each step must be completed before the developers can move on to the following step and once a new step has been reached a developer cannot go back to the previous step and make any changes. One of the reasons for this is because the Waterfall model stresses planning and strict documentation. Any changes to a previous step can only be accomplished by going back to the beginning of the waterfall and starting the design process over again.
As the waterfall model follows a strict design and end date, the model would be useful for a developer when the client has a specific picture of how the software needs to be and built within a specific time frame.


###The Agile Model


The agile model takes a more circular approach software design. Like in the waterfall model there are multiple steps to this approach, define requirements, plan, development, customer feedback/deliver product). The Agile system is based off of four key points that differ from the waterfall methods of development, “individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan” (Beck, Kent; et al, 2001). Each of these steps is performed multiple times. The requirements step is where a team figured out what they will focus on for this iteration of the loop. This can be anything from creating a database to getting the user interface up and running. Next the team plans out how this will get done in a short, reasonable amount of time. The development step, also known as a sprint, is where the team creates whatever they were planning to. Next they get customer feedback (if possible) and show what they have done to their superior to see if any feedback is given. This process is then repeated over and over again until the development of the system is finished. This model is very useful for teams because there is a lot of communication happening between individuals and everyone knows where everyone else stands on their assignment. This allows the team to help anyone who is struggling and to reduce stressful situations. 


###Similarities Between the Two Models


While both the waterfall method and agile methods of development seem vastly different they do share a few things in common. Both systems have similar stages throughout development. Both feature a define requirements stage where the outline of what need to be done is created. A planning and implementation stage is the main part in both systems because this is the coding work gets done. In agile the testing is done within this stage while in waterfall the testing has its own. Maintenance is then both needed on the final product as it is on all software. While they achieve it in different ways, both systems of development share a common a goal, to create the best possible product for the customer and the client. 


###Differences Between the Two Models


One key difference between the two models is how feedback is utilised. Due to the linearity of development the waterfall model does not allow for a change in requirements because no feedback is given or provides no guidance on how the feedback can be addressed. For example, if an unexpected problem occurs during development (such as losing development personnel) there may be limited resources or a plan in place to mitigate the problem. The Agile model provides a solution to this.


As work is done in sprints in the agile model, at the end of each sprint the project priorities can be evaluated taking into account feedback from the development team (such as through continuous integration) and the customer before the next sprint is acted upon. This model allows the customer to have a product that suits their evolving needs and is fit for purpose. 
Another key difference is the sequential and iterative approach to software development. With a sequential approach the completed date of a project cannot be changed until the latter stages of development. With the agile model the end date can be assessed after each sprint increasing uncertainty for when the project will be completed. Developing software in a sequential style also means that the project needs to be heavily documented to foresee any potential delays and agree on a completion date for the customer. The more planning involved it is easier to guesstimate how long the project will take.


###Conclusion


In choosing which model to use for a software project you need to take into account a number of factors. If an organisation feels that technology and business markets are changing rapidly and that software development should match this trend then the Agile model should be chosen for a project as agile is better for larger teams and customer who having evolving needs.
Although, if requirements will remain unchanged throughout the project or the project is very simple or has groups which do not overlap then the waterfall model would be more suitable. Also, for those new to software development the waterfall model may be easier to understand and “often teams feel more comfortable with this approach” (Bowes, 2014). This argument is supported by VersionOne (2014) who discovered that the barrier to further agile development in companies are the “inability to change organisational culture”.
However, usually software projects are not simple and the most used model seems to be agile according to VersionOne as 88% of respondents to their survey said their organisation were practising agile development up from 80% in 2011.
Therefore it can be argued that both models have their strengths and weaknesses and choosing which model is the right one for a project should be based on the context of the project.
